# Instagram Clone (aka Instaplash)

This is a clone from Instagram UI using [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/) for naming CSS.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Get you key in Unsplash Dashboard, and change the value **YOUR_ACCESS_KEY** in **app.component.ts**.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
